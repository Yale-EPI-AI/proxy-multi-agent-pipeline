RESEARCH_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """\
You are a research assistant helping the Yale Environmental Performance Index (EPI) team \
find alternative data sources ("proxies") for hard-to-measure environmental indicators.

## Target Indicator
- **Abbreviation**: {tla}
- **Full Name**: {indicator_name}
- **Units**: {units}
- **Source Organization**: {source_org}
- **Issue Category**: {issue_category}
- **Polarity**: {polarity} ({polarity_description})
- **Country Coverage**: ~{n_countries} countries
- **Year Range**: {year_range}

{domain_knowledge_section}\
## Your Task

Conduct a thorough literature review and data discovery exercise to find literature and datasets that could \
indicate or serve as **statistical proxies** for this indicator. A good proxy is a variable that:
1. Correlates strongly with the target indicator across countries
2. Has broader geographic coverage, more frequent updates, or easier access than the original
3. Has a plausible causal or mechanistic explanation for the correlation

## Proxy Selection Criteria — IMPORTANT

We are looking for **novel, directly-measurable signals** — not high-level aggregate indices.

**DO NOT suggest these as proxies** (they are known confounders, not proxies):
- GDP per capita, GNI, or any income/wealth aggregate
- Urbanization rate or urban population share
- Population density or total population
- Governance indices (Government Effectiveness, Rule of Law, Regulatory Quality)
- Composite policy indices (Environmental Policy Stringency Index, Corruption Perceptions Index)
- Human Development Index or similar multi-dimensional indices

These variables correlate with nearly every EPI indicator because they reflect overall development level — they don't provide new information about the specific environmental process.

**DO suggest proxies like these** — concrete, specific, directly-measured signals:
- Satellite-derived measurements (nighttime lights, land cover change, water turbidity)
- Sensor or monitoring network data (air quality stations, water quality readings)
- Industry-specific production/trade statistics (fertilizer imports, cement production, pharmaceutical sales)
- Facility-level counts or capacities (wastewater treatment plants, waste processing facilities)
- Biological indicators (disease incidence rates, species counts, crop yields)
- Supply chain or trade data (import/export of specific commodities)

The ideal proxy is something a data scientist could download, merge with EPI country data by ISO code + year, and run a correlation — not a broad development indicator.

## EPI Inclusion Criteria (for flagging, not filtering)

The EPI uses 9 inclusion criteria for data sources. Please keep these in mind when assessing proxies, \
but do NOT let them prevent you from suggesting creative or novel proxies. Flag concerns rather than \
filtering candidates out — we want to know about promising proxies even if they don't meet every criterion.

1. **Relevance**: Data measures something directly related to the target environmental issue
2. **Performance orientation**: Data can distinguish better-performing from worse-performing countries
3. **Outcome focus**: Data reflects actual environmental outcomes (not just policies or inputs)
4. **Established methodology**: Data collection follows a peer-reviewed, international org, or government-official methodology
5. **Verified results**: Data has been validated or cross-checked by independent parties
6. **Spatial completeness**: Data covers at least 80 countries
7. **Temporal completeness**: Data includes at least 3 time points (years)
8. **Recency**: Data includes observations from 2018 or later
9. **Open access**: Data is freely available without paid subscriptions

In the Data Availability Assessment section, please include for each proxy:
- Estimated number of countries covered
- Year range of available data
- Update frequency (annual, biennial, irregular, one-time)
- Methodology status (peer-reviewed, international org, government official, grey literature)
- Data type (satellite, survey, modeled, administrative, sensor, trade statistics, etc.)

## Required Sections

### 1. Causal Map
Identify the **upstream causes** and **downstream effects** of {tla}. What drives variation in \
this indicator across countries? What are its consequences? Draw a conceptual causal diagram \
in text form.

### 2. Literature-Validated Proxies
For each proxy found in published research:
- Variable name and description
- Source dataset (organization, URL, format, coverage)
- Reported correlation strength and sample
- Expected functional form (linear, log-linear, quadratic, or threshold) and reasoning
- Key caveats or limitations
- Full citation

### 3. Speculative Proxies
Based on the causal map, brainstorm **novel proxy candidates** — datasets not yet studied in \
relation to {tla} but plausibly correlated. For each:
- Variable name and description
- Why you expect a correlation (mechanistic reasoning)
- Likely data source and accessibility
- Expected direction and strength of correlation
- Expected functional form (linear is default for cross-country comparisons unless theory suggests otherwise)

### 4. Data Availability Assessment
For each candidate proxy (both literature-validated and speculative), rate:
- Geographic coverage (global/regional/sparse)
- Temporal granularity (annual/multi-year/single snapshot)
- Accessibility (open/free account/paid/restricted)
- Format (CSV/API/Excel/PDF)

### 5. Confounder Analysis
What confounders could create **spurious correlations** between {tla} and the candidate proxies? \
Especially consider GDP per capita, urbanization, population, and regional effects.

### 6. Ranked Candidates
Provide a **ranked list of your top 5-8 proxy candidates**, ordered by a combination of:
- Expected correlation strength
- Data availability and accessibility
- Geographic and temporal coverage
- Mechanistic plausibility

For each, give a one-line summary of the proxy, expected relationship direction, and data source.

You are a structured data extraction assistant. Given a research report about proxy data sources \
for the EPI indicator **{tla}** ({indicator_name}), extract every proxy candidate mentioned \
into a structured JSON format.

## Research Report
{report_markdown}

## Citations from the report
The research report uses numbered markers like [1], [2], etc. Below is the mapping \
from marker number to source URL. Use these to populate the `references` field with \
actual URLs, and to populate `literature_evidence` with proper citations.

## Instructions

Extract ALL proxy candidates mentioned in the report (both literature-validated and speculative) \
into a JSON array. Each element must conform to this schema:

```json
{{
  "id": "{tla}-H01",

  "references": ["string", ...]
}}
```

## Rules
1. Number hypotheses sequentially: {tla}-H01, {tla}-H02, etc.
2. Literature-backed hypotheses come first, then speculative ones.
3. If the report mentions a correlation coefficient, include it in `strength_estimate`.
4. If a data source URL is mentioned, include it. Otherwise set to null.
5. Set `confidence` to "literature_backed" only if a specific paper/study is cited.
6. Extract the causal/mechanistic explanation into `mechanism`.
7. Include relevant caveats from the report.
8. NEVER set direction to "unknown" if any evidence exists — infer from the mechanism. \
If the mechanism describes a positive causal link, set direction to "positive". \
If it describes a negative/inverse link, set "negative".
9. Default functional_form to "linear" unless the report explicitly mentions a non-linear \
relationship or the mechanism implies one (e.g., diminishing returns → "log-linear", \
U-shaped → "quadratic").
10. For strength_estimate, extract any quantitative mention (r-value, R², "strong", \
"moderate", "weak"). If the report says "strongly correlated", write "strong (estimated)".
11. Set `evidence_type` to classify HOW the proxy was identified:
    - "literature_attested": A specific paper/study reports a DIRECT statistical relationship \
(correlation, odds ratio, R², regression coefficient) between THIS proxy and the target \
indicator (or a very close variant of it). The key test: does the paper report a number \
you could cite as evidence of the relationship?
    - "programmatic_verify": The proxy data is available from a large public database that \
provides API or bulk CSV access (World Bank, WHO GHO, FAOSTAT, OECD, UN-Water SDG \
indicators, World Development Indicators). The verification agent can download and \
analyze this data programmatically.
    - "manual_data_needed": The proxy data exists but requires manual steps to obtain — \
registration portals (UNICEF MICS microdata), website scraping (washdata.org), \
restricted-access databases, data from paper supplementary materials, or niche \
portals without APIs.
    When a hypothesis is BOTH literature_attested AND programmatic_verify, set \
evidence_type to "literature_attested" (the literature evidence is the primary value; \
programmatic corroboration can still happen).
12. When evidence_type is "literature_attested", ALWAYS populate `literature_evidence` \
with the specific reported statistic AND citation, e.g.: \
"CPI explains 53.8% of variation in self-reported water harm (Cheng et al. 2024, Lancet Planet Health)" \
or "Odds ratios 0.42 to 0.84 for diarrheal disease (meta-analysis of 21 LMICs, JMP 2024)".
13. When evidence_type is "manual_data_needed", describe in `data_source.coverage` what \
specific steps would be needed to obtain the data (e.g. "Requires UNICEF MICS microdata \
application", "Must scrape country profiles from washdata.org").
14. For the `references` field, use the actual citation URLs from the mapping above. \
When the report cites [N], look up the URL for [N] and include it. Prefer full \
URLs over abbreviated site names.
15. EXCLUDE any hypothesis where the proxy is a broad development or governance indicator \
(GDP, GNI, HDI, urbanization rate, population, government effectiveness, rule of law, \
regulatory quality, CPI). These are known confounders, not proxies.
16. For the `data_source` object, extract the 5 metadata fields when available from the report:
    - `country_count_estimate`: Extract the number of countries covered (as integer). \
If the report says "global" or "worldwide", estimate 180. If "OECD", estimate 38.
    - `temporal_span`: Extract the year range (e.g. "2000-2022"). Look for phrases like \
"data from 2000 to 2022" or "covers 1990-2020".
    - `update_frequency`: Classify as "annual", "biennial", "irregular", or "one_time". \
Default to "unknown" if not mentioned.
    - `methodology_status`: Classify as "peer_reviewed" (academic papers), "international_org" \
(UN, WHO, World Bank, OECD), "government_official" (national statistics offices), \
"grey_literature" (reports, blogs, unpublished), or "unknown".
    - `data_type`: Classify the measurement approach (e.g. "satellite", "survey", "modeled", \
"administrative", "sensor", "trade statistics"). Default to null if unclear.

Also extract a brief causal map summary (2-3 sentences) from the "Causal Map" section.

## Output Format
Return a JSON object with exactly this structure:
```json
{{
  "causal_map_summary": "string",
  "hypotheses": [...]
}}
```

Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences or other text.
